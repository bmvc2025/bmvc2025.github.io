We are soliciting proposals for workshops to be held together with the 2025 British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC 2025). Workshops will take place on **27th November 2025**.

The purpose of the workshops is to provide a comprehensive forum on topics that will not be fully explored during the main conference, as well as to encourage in-depth discussion of technical and application issues. We also welcome “Challenge Workshops” that aim to compare new and established methods on common data sets. BMVC 2025 organisers will collect workshop registrations, provide facilities, and distribute electronic copies of the workshop proceedings.

There will be competition for workshop space, time, and topic coverage. Proposals must be specific and detailed in justifying relevance and viability. Proposers may be asked to provide additional information, modify aspects of their proposals, or combine their proposals with another one. Also, note that publication deadlines are very tight between the main conference acceptance notification and the workshop camera-ready deadline, so proposers must be ready to undertake all the work related to soliciting and reviewing submissions and collecting final contributions.
Proposals should be submitted by 9th May 2025 (23:59 pm BST) using the Google Form below.
Proposals should include the following information:

- Workshop title.
- Proposers’ names, titles, affiliations, and primary contact email.
- Workshop description, key words
- Duration and type of the workshop
- Background including the past workshops, if exist,  and the past attendance statistics
- Rough program outline (estimated numbers of orals, posters, invited talks, etc).
- Preliminary program including names and bios of any invited speakers and an indication of whether they have agreed to speak.
- Anticipated target audience as well as the expected number of attendees.
- Relevance and viability 
- Commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion
- Any special space or equipment requests.

BMVC will cover the costs for rooms, coffee breaks, and A/V equipment. However, any other activities with budget implications will be the responsibility of the workshop organizers.
